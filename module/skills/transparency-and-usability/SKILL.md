# Transparency, Usability, and Compromise Recording

This skill combines three design principles that ensure security is transparent, usable, and observable.

## Open Design

**Principle:** Security mechanisms should not depend on secrecy of design. Protection relies on securely managed keys and credentials, not on hidden algorithms or architectures.

### Key Aspects

- **No security through obscurity:** Do not rely on attackers not knowing how the system works. Assume the design is known.
- **Transparency:** Open sharing of source code, development processes, and security mechanisms promotes understanding and enables external review
- **Scrutiny and engagement:** Broader community review improves quality and catches vulnerabilities that internal teams miss
- **Comprehensive documentation:** Provide architecture diagrams, component descriptions, interface specifications, and security mechanism documentation. Undocumented systems cannot be reviewed for design flaws or security gaps.

### Application

- Document system architecture, data flows, trust boundaries, and security mechanisms
- Ensure that if the design were fully disclosed, the system would still be secure (only keys/secrets protect it)
- Participate in security reviews and welcome external scrutiny

## Psychological Acceptability

**Principle:** Security controls should align with user expectations so that users routinely and automatically apply them as intended.

### Key Aspects

- **Ease of use:** Controls that are difficult to use will be bypassed or disabled. Security mechanisms must be intuitive.
- **Balanced cost:** The cost (time, friction, complexity) of security controls should not exceed the value of the asset being protected
- **Appropriate notification:** When security controls activate, provide enough information for users to understand why, without disclosing system internals

### Application

- Design authentication flows that match user expectations (SSO, MFA with clear prompts)
- Avoid security configurations that require expert knowledge to get right; provide safe defaults
- Make the secure path the easy path (pit of success)
- Test security UX with real users; measure bypass and error rates

## Compromise Recording

**Principle:** Reliable mechanisms must document and track security incidents, because no system is entirely immune to breaches.

### Key Aspects

- **Detection and notification:** Implement mechanisms to promptly detect and notify stakeholders of potential compromises
- **Forensic analysis:** Enable forensic investigation to understand the nature, extent, and impact of breaches
- **Incident response:** Facilitate effective response strategies to contain and mitigate breach impact
- **Accountability and transparency:** Establish clear processes for handling incidents; keep stakeholders informed
- **Continuous improvement:** Use insights from incidents to strengthen security controls

### Application

- Log all security-relevant events: authentication attempts, authorization failures, configuration changes, data access patterns
- Ensure logs are tamper-resistant and stored in a central, protected facility
- Implement automated alerting for anomalous patterns
- Maintain and test incident response procedures regularly
- Conduct post-incident reviews and update controls based on findings

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] System security does not depend on design secrecy (only keys/secrets)
- [ ] Architecture, data flows, and trust boundaries are documented
- [ ] Security mechanisms are documented and reviewable
- [ ] Security controls are usable and tested with real users
- [ ] The secure path is the default and easiest path
- [ ] Security notifications inform without over-disclosing system internals
- [ ] All security events are logged centrally (auth, authz, config changes)
- [ ] Logs are protected from tampering and unauthorized access
- [ ] Automated alerting is configured for anomalous patterns
- [ ] Incident response procedures exist and are tested regularly
- [ ] Post-incident reviews feed back into control improvements
