# Linux Capabilities

Restrict Linux capabilities to the minimum set required by each container. The default approach is to drop all capabilities and selectively add only those the workload needs.

## Default: Drop All Capabilities

Every container should drop all Linux capabilities unless specific ones are required:

```yaml
securityContext:
  capabilities:
    drop: ["ALL"]
```

At minimum, containers must drop `MKNOD`, `SETUID`, `SETGID`, and `KILL`. Dropping `ALL` is preferred as it is simpler and more restrictive.

## Dangerous Capabilities

The following capabilities are restricted by the certsuite and should not be added unless the workload has a documented exception.

### SYS_ADMIN

Provides extensive privileges including mounting filesystems, configuring namespaces, and performing many administrative operations. This is the most dangerous capability — effectively equivalent to running as root.

> **Required for:** all profiles (mandatory) — containers must not use SYS_ADMIN

### NET_ADMIN

Allows network configuration changes including interface configuration, firewall rules (iptables/nftables), and routing tables. Workload pods must not configure nftables or iptables — these should be managed by platform operators (e.g., Performance Addon Operator, Istio).

> **Required for:** Telco (mandatory), Far-Edge (mandatory), Extended (mandatory), Non-Telco (optional)

**Exception:** User plane or networking functions (e.g., SR-IOV, Multicast) may request an exception with documentation of which container needs the capability and why.

### NET_RAW

Enables raw socket creation and packet manipulation. Required together with NET_ADMIN for nftables modification, which workload pods should not do.

> **Required for:** Telco (mandatory), Far-Edge (mandatory), Extended (mandatory), Non-Telco (optional)

**Exception:** User plane or networking functions may request an exception.

### BPF

Allows loading eBPF programs into the kernel. eBPF can bypass security controls, monitor other processes, and potentially compromise the host.

> **Required for:** Telco (mandatory), Far-Edge (mandatory), Extended (mandatory), Non-Telco (optional)

### IPC_LOCK

Allows locking memory pages with `mlock()`, `mlockall()`, `shmctl()`, and `mmap()`. Locked memory cannot be swapped, potentially causing denial of service.

> **Required for:** Telco (mandatory), Far-Edge (mandatory), Extended (mandatory), Non-Telco (optional)

**Exception:** DPDK applications that require locked memory for packet buffers may request an exception.

## Required Capabilities

Some workloads must add specific capabilities to perform their required operations.

### SYS_NICE (Real-Time Kernel Nodes)

Pods scheduled to nodes with a real-time kernel must add `SYS_NICE` to allow DPDK applications to switch to `SCHED_FIFO` scheduling.

> **Required for:** Telco (mandatory), Far-Edge (mandatory), Extended (mandatory), Non-Telco (optional)

```yaml
securityContext:
  capabilities:
    drop: ["ALL"]
    add: ["SYS_NICE"]
```

### SYS_PTRACE (Process Namespace Sharing)

When `shareProcessNamespace: true` is set on a pod, containers that need to send signals to processes in other containers (e.g., `SIGHUP`) must have `SYS_PTRACE`.

> **Required for:** Telco (mandatory), Far-Edge (mandatory), Extended (mandatory), Non-Telco (optional)

```yaml
spec:
  shareProcessNamespace: true
  containers:
    - name: app
      securityContext:
        capabilities:
          drop: ["ALL"]
          add: ["SYS_PTRACE"]
```

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] All containers drop all capabilities (`drop: ["ALL"]`) or at minimum `MKNOD`, `SETUID`, `SETGID`, `KILL`
- [ ] No containers use `SYS_ADMIN`
- [ ] No containers use `NET_ADMIN` unless documented exception for user plane functions
- [ ] No containers use `NET_RAW` unless documented exception for user plane functions
- [ ] No containers use `BPF`
- [ ] No containers use `IPC_LOCK` unless documented exception for DPDK
- [ ] Pods on real-time kernel nodes add `SYS_NICE`
- [ ] Pods with `shareProcessNamespace: true` add `SYS_PTRACE` where needed
