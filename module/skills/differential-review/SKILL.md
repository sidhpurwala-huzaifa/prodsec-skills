# Differential Security Review

Security-focused code review for PRs, commits, and diffs.

## Core Principles

1. **Risk-First**: Focus on auth, crypto, value transfer, external calls
2. **Evidence-Based**: Every finding backed by git history, line numbers, attack scenarios
3. **Adaptive**: Scale to codebase size (SMALL/MEDIUM/LARGE)
4. **Honest**: Explicitly state coverage limits and confidence level
5. **Output-Driven**: Always generate comprehensive markdown report file

---

## Rationalizations (Do Not Skip)

| Rationalization | Why It's Wrong | Required Action |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "Small PR, quick review" | Heartbleed was 2 lines | Classify by RISK, not size |
| "I know this codebase" | Familiarity breeds blind spots | Build explicit baseline context |
| "Git history takes too long" | History reveals regressions | Never skip Phase 1 |
| "Blast radius is obvious" | You'll miss transitive callers | Calculate quantitatively |
| "No tests = not my problem" | Missing tests = elevated risk rating | Flag in report, elevate severity |
| "Just a refactor, no security impact" | Refactors break invariants | Analyze as HIGH until proven LOW |
| "I'll explain verbally" | No artifact = findings lost | Always write report |

---

## Quick Reference

### Codebase Size Strategy

| Codebase Size | Strategy | Approach |
|---------------|----------|----------|
| SMALL (<20 files) | DEEP | Read all deps, full git blame |
| MEDIUM (20-200) | FOCUSED | 1-hop deps, priority files |
| LARGE (200+) | SURGICAL | Critical paths only |

### Risk Level Triggers

| Risk Level | Triggers |
|------------|----------|
| HIGH | Auth, crypto, external calls, value transfer, validation removal |
| MEDIUM | Business logic, state changes, new public APIs |
| LOW | Comments, tests, UI, logging |

## Quality Checklist

Before delivering:

- [ ] All changed files analyzed
- [ ] Git blame on removed security code
- [ ] Blast radius calculated for HIGH risk
- [ ] Attack scenarios are concrete (not generic)
- [ ] Findings reference specific line numbers + commits
- [ ] Report file generated
- [ ] User notified with summary

---

## Integration

**audit-context-building** (`audit-context-building.md` in this folder):
- Pre-Analysis: Build baseline context
- Phase 4: Deep context on HIGH RISK changes

**Formal reporting:** Transform findings into formal audit reports using your team's workflow.

*(See upstream Trail of Bits prodsec-skills for the `issue-writer` companion skill if you use that distribution.)*

---

## Example Usage

### Quick Triage (Small PR)
```
Input: 5 file PR, 2 HIGH RISK files
Strategy: Use Quick Reference
1. Classify risk level per file (2 HIGH, 3 LOW)
2. Focus on 2 HIGH files only
3. Git blame removed code
4. Generate minimal report
Time: ~30 minutes
```

### Standard Review (Medium Codebase)
```
Input: 80 files, 12 HIGH RISK changes
Strategy: FOCUSED (see [Differential Review Methodology](#differential-review-methodology))
1. Full workflow on HIGH RISK files
2. Surface scan on MEDIUM
3. Skip LOW risk files
4. Complete report with all sections
Time: ~3-4 hours
```

### Deep Audit (Large, Critical Change)
```
Input: 450 files, auth system rewrite
Strategy: SURGICAL + audit-context-building
1. Baseline context with audit-context-building
2. Deep analysis on auth changes only
3. Blast radius analysis
4. Adversarial modeling
5. Comprehensive report
Time: ~6-8 hours
```

---

## When NOT to Use This Skill

- **Greenfield code** (no baseline to compare)
- **Documentation-only changes** (no security impact)
- **Formatting/linting** (cosmetic changes)
- **User explicitly requests quick summary only** (they accept risk)

For these cases, use standard code review instead.

---

## Red Flags (Stop and Investigate)

**Immediate escalation triggers:**
- Removed code from "security", "CVE", or "fix" commits
- Access control modifiers removed (onlyOwner, internal → external)
- Validation removed without replacement
- External calls added without checks
- High blast radius (50+ callers) + HIGH risk change

These patterns require adversarial analysis even in quick triage.

---

## Tips for Best Results

**Do:**
- Start with git blame for removed code
- Calculate blast radius early to prioritize
- Generate concrete attack scenarios
- Reference specific line numbers and commits
- Be honest about coverage limitations
- Always generate the output file

**Don't:**
- Skip git history analysis
- Make generic findings without evidence
- Claim full analysis when time-limited
- Forget to check test coverage
- Miss high blast radius changes
- Output report only to chat (file required)

# Differential Review Methodology

Detailed phase-by-phase workflow for security-focused code review.

## Pre-Analysis: Baseline Context Building

**FIRST ACTION - Build complete baseline understanding:**

If the **audit-context-building** workflow is available (see `audit-context-building.md` in this folder):

1. Check out the baseline commit: `git checkout <baseline_commit>`
2. Apply ultra-granular context building to the entire relevant scope (e.g. `packages/contracts/contracts/` for Solidity, `src/` for Rust, or repository root).
3. Focus on invariants, trust boundaries, validation patterns, call graphs, and state flows.

*(See upstream Trail of Bits prodsec-skills for companion automation or agent wiring.)*

**Capture from baseline analysis:**
- System-wide invariants (what must ALWAYS be true across all code)
- Trust boundaries and privilege levels (who can do what)
- Validation patterns (what gets checked where - defense-in-depth)
- Complete call graphs for critical functions (who calls what)
- State flow diagrams (how state changes)
- External dependencies and trust assumptions

**Why this matters:**
- Understand what the code was SUPPOSED to do before changes
- Identify implicit security assumptions in baseline
- Detect when changes violate baseline invariants
- Know which patterns are system-wide vs local
- Catch when changes break defense-in-depth

**Store baseline context for reference during differential analysis.**

After baseline analysis, checkout back to head commit to analyze changes.

---

## Phase 0: Intake & Triage

**Extract changes:**
```bash
# For commit range
git diff <base>..<head> --stat
git log <base>..<head> --oneline

# For PR
gh pr view <number> --json files,additions,deletions

# Get all changed files
git diff <base>..<head> --name-only
```

**Assess codebase size:**
```bash
find . -name "*.sol" -o -name "*.rs" -o -name "*.go" -o -name "*.ts" | wc -l
```

**Classify complexity:**
- **SMALL**: <20 files → Deep analysis (read all deps)
- **MEDIUM**: 20-200 files → Focused analysis (1-hop deps)
- **LARGE**: 200+ files → Surgical (critical paths only)

**Risk score each file:**
- **HIGH**: Auth, crypto, external calls, value transfer, validation removal
- **MEDIUM**: Business logic, state changes, new public APIs
- **LOW**: Comments, tests, UI, logging

---

## Phase 1: Changed Code Analysis

For each changed file:

1. **Read both versions** (baseline and changed)

2. **Analyze each diff region:**
   ```
   BEFORE: [exact code]
   AFTER: [exact code]
   CHANGE: [behavioral impact]
   SECURITY: [implications]
   ```

3. **Git blame removed code:**
   ```bash
   # When was it added? Why?
   git log -S "removed_code" --all --oneline
   git blame <baseline> -- file.sol | grep "pattern"
   ```

   **Red flags:**
   - Removed code from "fix", "security", "CVE" commits → CRITICAL
   - Recently added (<1 month) then removed → HIGH

4. **Check for regressions (re-added code):**
   ```bash
   git log -S "added_code" --all -p
   ```

   Pattern: Code added → removed for security → re-added now = REGRESSION

5. **Micro-adversarial analysis** for each change:
   - What attack did removed code prevent?
   - What new surface does new code expose?
   - Can modified logic be bypassed?
   - Are checks weaker? Edge cases covered?

6. **Generate concrete attack scenarios:**
   ```
   SCENARIO: [attack goal]
   PRECONDITIONS: [required state]
   STEPS:
     1. [specific action]
     2. [expected outcome]
     3. [exploitation]
   WHY IT WORKS: [reference code change]
   IMPACT: [severity + scope]
   ```

---

## Phase 2: Test Coverage Analysis

**Identify coverage gaps:**
```bash
# Production code changes (exclude tests)
git diff <range> --name-only | grep -v "test"

# Test changes
git diff <range> --name-only | grep "test"

# For each changed function, search for tests
grep -r "test.*functionName" test/ --include="*.sol" --include="*.js"
```

**Risk elevation rules:**
- NEW function + NO tests → Elevate risk MEDIUM→HIGH
- MODIFIED validation + UNCHANGED tests → HIGH RISK
- Complex logic (>20 lines) + NO tests → HIGH RISK

---

## Phase 3: Blast Radius Analysis

**Calculate impact:**
```bash
# Count callers for each modified function
grep -r "functionName(" --include="*.sol" . | wc -l
```

**Classify blast radius:**
- 1-5 calls: LOW
- 6-20 calls: MEDIUM
- 21-50 calls: HIGH
- 50+ calls: CRITICAL

**Priority matrix:**

| Change Risk | Blast Radius | Priority | Analysis Depth |
|-------------|--------------|----------|----------------|
| HIGH | CRITICAL | P0 | Deep + all deps |
| HIGH | HIGH/MEDIUM | P1 | Deep |
| HIGH | LOW | P2 | Standard |
| MEDIUM | CRITICAL/HIGH | P1 | Standard + callers |

---

## Phase 4: Deep Context Analysis

**If the audit-context-building workflow is available**, use it on the changed function and its dependencies to help answer the questions below. Scope the file(s) containing the changed function; focus on flow analysis, call graphs, invariants, and root cause.

*(See upstream Trail of Bits prodsec-skills for companion automation.)*

**That workflow helps you answer:**

1. **Map complete function flow:**
   - Entry conditions (preconditions, requires, modifiers)
   - State reads (which variables accessed)
   - State writes (which variables modified)
   - External calls (to contracts, APIs, system)
   - Return values and side effects

2. **Trace internal calls:**
   - List all functions called
   - Recursively map their flows
   - Build complete call graph

3. **Trace external calls:**
   - Identify trust boundaries crossed
   - List assumptions about external behavior
   - Check for reentrancy risks

4. **Identify invariants:**
   - What must ALWAYS be true?
   - What must NEVER happen?
   - Are invariants maintained after changes?

5. **Five Whys root cause:**
   - WHY was this code changed?
   - WHY did the original code exist?
   - WHY might this break?
   - WHY is this approach chosen?
   - WHY could this fail in production?

**If that workflow is not used**, manually perform the line-by-line analysis above using your editor, search, and code tracing.

**Cross-cutting pattern detection:**
```bash
# Find repeated validation patterns
grep -r "require.*amount > 0" --include="*.sol" .
grep -r "onlyOwner" --include="*.sol" .

# Check if any removed in diff
git diff <range> | grep "^-.*require.*amount > 0"
```

**Flag if removal breaks defense-in-depth.**

**Next steps:**
- For HIGH RISK changes, proceed to [Adversarial Vulnerability Analysis (Phase 5)](#adversarial-vulnerability-analysis-phase-5)
- For report generation, see [Report Generation (Phase 6)](#report-generation-phase-6)

# Adversarial Vulnerability Analysis (Phase 5)

Structured methodology for finding vulnerabilities through attacker modeling.

**When to use:** After completing deep context analysis (Phase 4), apply this to all HIGH RISK changes.

---

## 1. Define Specific Attacker Model

**WHO is the attacker?**
- Unauthenticated external user
- Authenticated regular user
- Malicious administrator
- Compromised contract/service
- Front-runner/MEV bot

**WHAT access/privileges do they have?**
- Public API access only
- Authenticated user role
- Specific permissions/tokens
- Contract call capabilities

**WHERE do they interact with the system?**
- Specific HTTP endpoints
- Smart contract functions
- RPC interfaces
- External APIs

---

## 2. Identify Concrete Attack Vectors

```
ENTRY POINT: [Exact function/endpoint attacker can access]

ATTACK SEQUENCE:
1. [Specific API call/transaction with parameters]
2. [How this reaches the vulnerable code]
3. [What happens in the vulnerable code]
4. [Impact achieved]

PROOF OF ACCESSIBILITY:
- Show the function is public/external
- Demonstrate attacker has required permissions
- Prove attack path exists through actual interfaces
```

---

## 3. Rate Realistic Exploitability

**EASY:** Exploitable via public APIs with no special privileges
- Single transaction/call
- Common user access level
- No complex conditions required

**MEDIUM:** Requires specific conditions or elevated privileges
- Multiple steps or timing requirements
- Elevated but obtainable privileges
- Specific system state needed

**HARD:** Requires privileged access or rare conditions
- Admin/owner privileges needed
- Rare edge case conditions
- Significant resources required

---

## 4. Build Complete Exploit Scenario

```
ATTACKER STARTING POSITION:
[What the attacker has at the beginning]

STEP-BY-STEP EXPLOITATION:
Step 1: [Concrete action through accessible interface]
  - Command: [Exact call/request]
  - Parameters: [Specific values]
  - Expected result: [What happens]

Step 2: [Next action]
  - Command: [Exact call/request]
  - Why this works: [Reference to code change]
  - System state change: [What changed]

Step 3: [Final impact]
  - Result: [Concrete harm achieved]
  - Evidence: [How to verify impact]

CONCRETE IMPACT:
[Specific, measurable impact - not "could cause issues"]
- Exact amount of funds drained
- Specific privileges escalated
- Particular data exposed
```

---

## 5. Cross-Reference with Baseline Context

From baseline analysis (see [Differential Review Methodology](#differential-review-methodology)), check:
- Does this violate a system-wide invariant?
- Does this break a trust boundary?
- Does this bypass a validation pattern?
- Is this a regression of a previous fix?

---

## Vulnerability Report Template

Generate this for each finding:

```markdown
## [SEVERITY] Vulnerability Title

**Attacker Model:**
- WHO: [Specific attacker type]
- ACCESS: [Exact privileges]
- INTERFACE: [Specific entry point]

**Attack Vector:**
[Step-by-step exploit through accessible interfaces]

**Exploitability:** EASY/MEDIUM/HARD
**Justification:** [Why this rating]

**Concrete Impact:**
[Specific, measurable harm - not theoretical]

**Proof of Concept:**
```code
// Exact code to reproduce
```

**Root Cause:**
[Reference specific code change at file.sol:L123]

**Blast Radius:** [N callers affected]
**Baseline Violation:** [Which invariant/pattern broken]
```

---

## Example: Complete Adversarial Analysis

**Change:** Removed `require(amount > 0)` check from `withdraw()` function

### 1. Attacker Model
- **WHO:** Unauthenticated external user
- **ACCESS:** Can call public contract functions
- **INTERFACE:** `withdraw(uint256 amount)` at 0x1234...

### 2. Attack Vector
**ENTRY POINT:** `withdraw(0)`

**ATTACK SEQUENCE:**
1. Call `withdraw(0)` from attacker address
2. Code bypasses amount check (removed)
3. Withdraw event emitted with 0 amount
4. Accounting updated incorrectly

**PROOF:** Function is `external`, no auth required

### 3. Exploitability
**RATING:** EASY
- Single transaction
- Public function
- No special state required

### 4. Exploit Scenario
**ATTACKER POSITION:** Has user account with 0 balance

**EXPLOITATION:**
```solidity
Step 1: attacker.withdraw(0)
  - Passes removed validation
  - Emits Withdraw(user, 0)
  - Updates withdrawnAmount[user] += 0

Step 2: Off-chain indexer sees Withdraw event
  - Credits attacker for 0 withdrawal
  - But accounting thinks withdrawal happened

Step 3: Accounting mismatch exploited
  - Total supply decremented
  - User balance not changed
  - System invariants broken
```

**IMPACT:**
- Protocol accounting corrupted
- Can be used to manipulate LP calculations
- Estimated $50K impact on pool prices

### 5. Baseline Violation
- Violates invariant: "All withdrawals must transfer non-zero value"
- Breaks validation pattern: Amount checks present in all other value transfers
- Regression: Check added in commit abc123 "Fix zero-amount exploit"

---

**Next:** Document all findings in final report (see [Report Generation (Phase 6)](#report-generation-phase-6))

| file1.sol | +50 | -20 | HIGH | CRITICAL |
| file2.sol | +10 | -5 | MEDIUM | LOW |

**Total:** +N, -M lines across K files
```

---

### 3. Critical Findings

For each HIGH/CRITICAL issue:

```markdown
### [SEVERITY] Title

**File**: path/to/file.ext:lineNumber
**Commit**: hash
**Blast Radius**: N callers (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
**Test Coverage**: YES/NO/PARTIAL

**Description**: [clear explanation]

**Historical Context**:
- Git blame: Added in commit X (date)
- Message: "[original commit message]"
- [Why this code existed]

**Attack Scenario**:
[Concrete exploitation steps from adversarial.md]

**Proof of Concept**:
```code demonstrating issue```

**Recommendation**:
[Specific fix with code]
```

**Example:**
```markdown
### 🔴 CRITICAL: Authorization Bypass in Withdraw

**File**: TokenVault.sol:156
**Commit**: abc123def
**Blast Radius**: 23 callers (HIGH)
**Test Coverage**: NO

**Description**:
Removed `require(msg.sender == owner)` check allows any user to withdraw funds.

**Historical Context**:
- Git blame: Added 2024-06-15 (commit def456)
- Message: "Add owner check per audit finding #45"
- Code existed to prevent unauthorized withdrawals

**Attack Scenario**:
1. Attacker calls `withdraw(1000 ether)`
2. No authorization check (removed)
3. 1000 ETH transferred to attacker
4. Protocol funds drained

**Proof of Concept**:
```solidity
// As any address
vault.withdraw(vault.balance());
// Success - funds stolen
```

**Recommendation**:
```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 amount) external {
+   require(msg.sender == owner, "Unauthorized");
    // ... rest of function
}
```
```

## User Notification Template

After generating report:

```markdown
Report generated successfully!

📄 File: [filename]
📁 Location: [path]
📏 Size: XX KB
⏱️ Review Time: ~X hours

Summary:
- X findings (Y critical, Z high)
- Final recommendation: APPROVE/REJECT/CONDITIONAL
- Confidence: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW

Next steps:
- Review findings in detail
- Address CRITICAL/HIGH issues before merge
- Consider chaining with your team's formal report workflow for stakeholders
```

---

## Integration with formal reporting

After generating differential review, transform into audit report:

Use your team's issue or formal report workflow to transform the markdown into stakeholder-facing format if needed.

*(See upstream Trail of Bits prodsec-skills for the `issue-writer` companion skill if you use that distribution.)*

This creates polished documentation for non-technical stakeholders.

---

## Error Handling

If file write fails:
1. Try Desktop location
2. Try temp directory
3. As last resort, output full report to chat
4. Notify user to save manually

**Always prioritize persistent artifact generation over ephemeral chat output.**

# Common Vulnerability Patterns

Quick reference for detecting common security issues in code changes.
Examples use Python and Go to illustrate patterns, but the underlying
vulnerabilities apply across a full stack — system software,
OpenShift operators, Ansible modules, C/C++ daemons, Rust tooling, and
beyond. Adapt examples to the language and framework of the code under review.

Domain-specific auditing skills in this repository complement the patterns below.

---

## Security Regressions

**Pattern:** Code previously removed for a security fix is re-added in a later change.

**Detection:**
```bash
# Search for code that was removed in a security-related commit
git log -S "pattern" --all --grep="security\|fix\|CVE"
git diff <range> | grep "^+"
```

**Red flags:**
- Commit message of the original removal contains "security", "fix", "CVE", "vulnerability"
- Code removed less than 6 months ago
- No explanation in current PR for re-addition

#### Python

```python
# VULNERABLE: handler removed in commit abc123 "Fix SQL injection CVE-2024-5678"
# is re-added in current PR without the fix
@app.get("/users")
def list_users(name: str):
    query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '{name}'"  # REGRESSION: raw f-string SQL
    return db.execute(query).fetchall()

# SAFE: the parameterized version that the fix introduced
@app.get("/users")
def list_users(name: str):
    return db.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = :n", {"n": name}).fetchall()
```

#### Go

```go
// VULNERABLE: endpoint removed in commit abc123 "Fix path traversal CVE-2024-9012"
// is re-added without sanitization
func serveFile(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    path := r.URL.Query().Get("file")
    http.ServeFile(w, r, filepath.Join("/data", path)) // REGRESSION: unsanitized path
}

// SAFE: resolve the full path and verify it stays under the allowed root
func serveFile(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    name := filepath.Clean(r.URL.Query().Get("file"))
    full := filepath.Join("/data", name)
    if !strings.HasPrefix(full, "/data/") {
        http.Error(w, "forbidden", http.StatusForbidden)
        return
    }
    http.ServeFile(w, r, full)
}
```

**Risk:** A previously patched vulnerability is silently reintroduced.

## Double Accounting Bugs

**Pattern:** The same accounting operation (balance update, counter increment, quota deduction) is applied twice for a single logical event.

**Detection:**
```bash
# Look for duplicate state mutations in related functions
grep -rn "balance\|quota\|count\|credit\|debit" --include="*.py" --include="*.go"
git diff <range> | grep -E "^\+.*(balance|quota|credit|debit)"
```

#### Python

```python
# VULNERABLE: balance deducted in both request and processing stages
def request_withdrawal(user_id: str, amount: Decimal):
    user = db.query(User).get(user_id)
    user.balance -= amount  # first deduction
    db.commit()
    withdrawal_queue.enqueue(user_id, amount)

def process_withdrawal(user_id: str, amount: Decimal):
    user = db.query(User).get(user_id)
    user.balance -= amount  # second deduction -- BUG
    db.commit()
    transfer_funds(user_id, amount)

# SAFE: deduct once, mark the withdrawal as processed
def request_withdrawal(user_id: str, amount: Decimal):
    user = db.query(User).get(user_id)
    user.balance -= amount
    db.commit()
    withdrawal_queue.enqueue(user_id, amount)

def process_withdrawal(user_id: str, amount: Decimal):
    # Balance already deducted during request; only execute transfer
    transfer_funds(user_id, amount)
    mark_complete(user_id, amount)
```

#### Go

```go
// VULNERABLE: inventory decremented in both reservation and fulfillment
func ReserveItem(db *sql.DB, itemID int, qty int) error {
    _, err := db.Exec("UPDATE inventory SET stock = stock - $1 WHERE id = $2", qty, itemID)
    return err // first decrement
}

func FulfillOrder(db *sql.DB, itemID int, qty int) error {
    _, err := db.Exec("UPDATE inventory SET stock = stock - $1 WHERE id = $2", qty, itemID) // BUG: second decrement
    return err
}

// SAFE: decrement once during reservation; fulfillment only ships
func FulfillOrder(db *sql.DB, itemID int, qty int) error {
    _, err := db.Exec("UPDATE orders SET status = 'shipped' WHERE item_id = $1 AND qty = $2", itemID, qty)
    return err
}
```

**Risk:** Users lose funds or resources twice, or the system drifts into an inconsistent state.

---

## Missing Validation

**Pattern:** Input validation or error checks are removed or absent without an equivalent replacement.

**Detection:**
```bash
# Removed validation keywords across languages
git diff <range> | grep "^-" | grep -E "raise|assert|validate|ValueError|HTTPException|if err|return err|http\.Error|errors\."
```

**Questions to ask:**
- Was validation moved to a different layer (middleware, schema)?
- Is the removal intentional and safe, or does it expose a vulnerability?
- Does the removed check guard against attacker-controlled input?

#### Python

```python
# VULNERABLE: validation removed from FastAPI handler
@router.post("/transfer")
def transfer(body: dict):
    # No validation -- amount could be negative, zero, or absurdly large
    execute_transfer(body["from_account"], body["to_account"], body["amount"])

# SAFE: Pydantic model enforces constraints
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class TransferRequest(BaseModel):
    from_account: str = Field(min_length=1)
    to_account: str = Field(min_length=1)
    amount: Decimal = Field(gt=0, le=1_000_000)

@router.post("/transfer")
def transfer(body: TransferRequest):
    execute_transfer(body.from_account, body.to_account, body.amount)
```

#### Go

```go
// VULNERABLE: no input validation in HTTP handler
func transferHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    var req TransferRequest
    json.NewDecoder(r.Body).Decode(&req) // error ignored, fields unchecked
    executeTransfer(req.From, req.To, req.Amount)
}

// SAFE: validate all fields before use
func transferHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    var req TransferRequest
    if err := json.NewDecoder(r.Body).Decode(&req); err != nil {
        http.Error(w, "invalid request body", http.StatusBadRequest)
        return
    }
    if req.Amount <= 0 || req.Amount > 1_000_000 {
        http.Error(w, "amount out of range", http.StatusBadRequest)
        return
    }
    if req.From == "" || req.To == "" {
        http.Error(w, "missing account", http.StatusBadRequest)
        return
    }
    executeTransfer(req.From, req.To, req.Amount)
}
```

**Risk:** Attackers supply malformed or malicious input that bypasses business rules.

---

## Integer Overflow and Type Coercion Errors

**Pattern:** Arithmetic on integers that can silently wrap around or lose precision during type conversion. In languages with fixed-width integers (Go, C, Rust) values wrap or truncate; in Python, implicit int-to-float conversion loses precision for large values.

**Detection:**
```bash
# Narrowing conversions and casts
grep -rn "int8\|int16\|uint8\|uint16\|int32\|uint32" --include="*.go"
grep -rn "as u8\|as u16\|as i16\|as i32" --include="*.rs"
grep -rn "(int16)\|(int32)\|(uint8)" --include="*.go"
# Python: implicit float conversion or unchecked large int
grep -rn "int(.*\.\|float(\|struct\.pack\|ctypes" --include="*.py"
```

#### Python

```python
# VULNERABLE: large user-supplied integer silently loses precision as float
def allocate_buffer(size_str: str) -> bytearray:
    size = int(size_str)
    factor = 1.5
    adjusted = int(size * factor)  # float multiplication -- loses precision for large ints
    return bytearray(adjusted)

# SAFE: keep arithmetic in integer domain and bound the input
def allocate_buffer(size_str: str) -> bytearray:
    size = int(size_str)
    if size <= 0 or size > 10 * 1024 * 1024:
        raise ValueError("size out of allowed range")
    adjusted = size + size // 2  # integer-only arithmetic
    return bytearray(adjusted)
```

#### Go

```go
// VULNERABLE: user-controlled value converted to int16, silently wraps
func setPort(input string) (int16, error) {
    v, err := strconv.Atoi(input)
    if err != nil {
        return 0, err
    }
    return int16(v), nil // 70000 wraps to 4464
}

// SAFE: validate range before narrowing conversion
func setPort(input string) (int16, error) {
    v, err := strconv.Atoi(input)
    if err != nil {
        return 0, err
    }
    if v < 0 || v > math.MaxInt16 {
        return 0, fmt.Errorf("port %d out of int16 range", v)
    }
    return int16(v), nil
}
```

**Risk:** Silent wrap-around or precision loss leads to under-allocated buffers, incorrect accounting, or bypassed limits.

---

## TOCTOU / Check-Then-Act Race Conditions

**Pattern:** A condition is checked and then acted upon, but the underlying state can change between the check and the action. This applies to database rows, file system state, and in-memory data accessed across async or concurrent boundaries.

**Detection:**
```bash
# Check-then-insert patterns in ORM or SQL code
grep -rn "if.*query.*first\|if.*exists\|if not.*get" --include="*.py"
# Check-then-act on shared state without atomicity
git diff <range> | grep "^+" | grep -E "\w+\[.*\]|\bLoad\b" | grep -v "sync\.\|mu\.\|atomic\."
# File-system TOCTOU (any language)
grep -rn "os\.path\.exists\|os\.access\|os\.Stat" --include="*.py" --include="*.go"
```

#### Python

```python
# VULNERABLE: check-then-insert without atomicity (SQLAlchemy)
def create_user(db: Session, email: str):
    existing = db.query(User).filter_by(email=email).first()
    if existing is None:
        # Another request can insert the same email between check and insert
        db.add(User(email=email))
        db.commit()

# SAFE: use a unique constraint and handle the conflict
def create_user(db: Session, email: str):
    try:
        db.add(User(email=email))
        db.commit()
    except IntegrityError:
        db.rollback()
        raise ValueError("email already registered")
```

#### Go

```go
// VULNERABLE: read-then-write on shared map without lock
var cache = make(map[string]int)

func Increment(key string) {
    val := cache[key]   // read
    cache[key] = val + 1 // write -- race if called from multiple goroutines
}

// SAFE: protect with a mutex
var (
    cache = make(map[string]int)
    mu    sync.Mutex
)

func Increment(key string) {
    mu.Lock()
    defer mu.Unlock()
    cache[key]++
}
```

**Risk:** Duplicate records, corrupted state, or privilege escalation when two operations interleave.

---

## Access Control Bypass

**Pattern:** Authentication or authorization checks are removed, relaxed, or skipped for certain routes or operations.

**Detection:**
```bash
# Removed auth decorators, middleware, or guard functions
git diff <range> | grep "^-" | grep -E "Depends\(|@login_required|@requires_auth|get_current_user|Permission|middleware|AuthRequired|RequireRole|checkAuth"
```

**Questions:**
- Who can now call this endpoint or function?
- Was the check moved to a different layer, or truly removed?
- What is the new trust boundary?

#### Python

```python
# VULNERABLE: auth dependency removed from FastAPI route
@router.put("/admin/config")
def update_config(body: ConfigUpdate):
    # Anyone can call this -- Depends(get_current_admin) was removed
    apply_config(body)

# SAFE: auth dependency enforced
@router.put("/admin/config")
def update_config(body: ConfigUpdate, admin: User = Depends(get_current_admin)):
    apply_config(body)
```

#### Go

```go
// VULNERABLE: auth middleware removed from route registration
mux.HandleFunc("/admin/config", updateConfigHandler)

// SAFE: auth middleware wraps the handler
mux.Handle("/admin/config", AuthRequired(http.HandlerFunc(updateConfigHandler)))
```

**Risk:** Unauthenticated or low-privilege users access admin functionality.

---

## Concurrency Race Conditions

**Pattern:** Shared mutable state accessed from multiple threads, goroutines, or async tasks without synchronization (locks, channels, atomics, or similar primitives).

**Detection:**
```bash
# Goroutines or threads launched near shared state
grep -rn "go func\|go .*(" --include="*.go"
grep -rn "threading\.\|asyncio\.\|concurrent\.futures" --include="*.py"
# Shared mutable globals
grep -rn "var.*=.*make\(map" --include="*.go"
```

#### Python

```python
# VULNERABLE: shared dict mutated from multiple async tasks
user_sessions: dict[str, int] = {}

async def track_login(user_id: str):
    count = user_sessions.get(user_id, 0)
    await asyncio.sleep(0)  # yields control -- another task can interleave
    user_sessions[user_id] = count + 1

# SAFE: use an asyncio.Lock to serialize access
session_lock = asyncio.Lock()

async def track_login(user_id: str):
    async with session_lock:
        user_sessions[user_id] = user_sessions.get(user_id, 0) + 1
```

#### Go

```go
// VULNERABLE: goroutines write to shared slice without synchronization
var results []string

func collect(items []string) {
    for _, item := range items {
        go func(s string) {
            results = append(results, s) // data race
        }(item)
    }
}

// SAFE: use a mutex or channel
var (
    results []string
    mu      sync.Mutex
)

func collect(items []string) {
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    for _, item := range items {
        wg.Add(1)
        go func(s string) {
            defer wg.Done()
            mu.Lock()
            results = append(results, s)
            mu.Unlock()
        }(item)
    }
    wg.Wait()
}
```

**Risk:** Data corruption, lost updates, panics, or non-deterministic behavior that is difficult to reproduce.

---

## Insecure Time-Based Logic

**Pattern:** Using wall-clock time for security-sensitive decisions such as token expiry, replay prevention, or rate limiting without accounting for clock skew, NTP jumps, or attacker-controlled clocks.

**Detection:**
```bash
# Wall-clock usage in security paths
grep -rn "time\.time()\|datetime\.now()\|datetime\.utcnow()" --include="*.py"
grep -rn "time\.Now()\|time\.Since\|time\.Until" --include="*.go"
grep -rn "System\.currentTimeMillis\|Instant\.now" --include="*.java"
```

#### Python

```python
# VULNERABLE: in-process rate limiter uses wall clock -- NTP jump backward
# resets the timer and allows a burst of requests
import time
last_request: dict[str, float] = {}

def is_rate_limited(user_id: str, min_interval: float = 1.0) -> bool:
    now = time.time()
    if now - last_request.get(user_id, 0.0) < min_interval:
        return True
    last_request[user_id] = now
    return False

# SAFE: monotonic clock is unaffected by NTP or system clock changes
last_request: dict[str, float] = {}

def is_rate_limited(user_id: str, min_interval: float = 1.0) -> bool:
    now = time.monotonic()
    if now - last_request.get(user_id, 0.0) < min_interval:
        return True
    last_request[user_id] = now
    return False
```

#### Go

```go
// VULNERABLE: replay window based on wall clock
func isRequestFresh(ts time.Time) bool {
    return time.Since(ts) < 30*time.Second // clock skew can make stale requests appear fresh
}

// SAFE: nonce prevents replay regardless of clock accuracy;
// time.Since on a parsed timestamp is still wall-clock-based, so the
// window check is best-effort -- the nonce is the real protection.
var seen sync.Map // NOTE: in production, prune entries older than the replay window to prevent unbounded growth

func isRequestFresh(ts time.Time, nonce string) bool {
    if time.Since(ts) > 30*time.Second {
        return false
    }
    if _, loaded := seen.LoadOrStore(nonce, struct{}{}); loaded {
        return false // replay detected
    }
    return true
}
```

**Risk:** Attackers replay expired tokens, bypass rate limits, or exploit clock skew to extend time-gated access.

---

## Unchecked Errors / Swallowed Exceptions

**Pattern:** Error return values are silently discarded or exceptions are caught with a bare handler and silently suppressed, hiding failures that should abort or alter control flow.

**Detection:**
```bash
# Ignored error return values (Go)
grep -rn "_, _ =" --include="*.go"
grep -rn ", _ :=" --include="*.go"
# Bare except or pass-only handlers (Python)
grep -rn "except:" --include="*.py"
grep -rn "except .*:" --include="*.py" -A1 | grep "pass"
# Ignored Result (Rust)
grep -rn "let _ =" --include="*.rs"
```

#### Python

```python
# VULNERABLE: bare except swallows all errors including auth failures
def authenticate(token: str) -> User:
    try:
        return verify_and_decode(token)
    except:
        pass  # silently returns None -- caller may treat None as "no auth required"

# SAFE: catch specific exceptions, let unexpected errors propagate
def authenticate(token: str) -> User:
    try:
        return verify_and_decode(token)
    except (jwt.ExpiredSignatureError, jwt.InvalidTokenError) as exc:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail=str(exc))
```

#### Go

```go
// VULNERABLE: Write and Close errors silently discarded -- partial or
// unflushed data is treated as success with no indication to the caller
func writeConfig(path string, data []byte) {
    f, err := os.Create(path)
    if err != nil {
        return // caller receives no error; config silently not written
    }
    f.Write(data) // error ignored -- partial write undetected
    f.Close()     // error ignored -- OS buffer may not be flushed
}

// SAFE: check every error; named return allows the deferred Close error to propagate
func writeConfig(path string, data []byte) (err error) {
    f, err := os.Create(path)
    if err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("create %s: %w", path, err)
    }
    defer func() {
        if cerr := f.Close(); cerr != nil && err == nil {
            err = cerr
        }
    }()
    _, err = f.Write(data)
    return
}
```

**Risk:** Silent failures lead to partial writes, data loss, authentication bypass, or inconsistent system state.

---

## Denial of Service / Unbounded Operations

**Pattern:** Operations that grow without bound based on user-controlled input: unbounded queries, thread/goroutine leaks, infinite loops, or unlimited memory allocation.

**Detection:**
```bash
# Unbounded queries or missing LIMIT
grep -rn "\.all()\|fetchall()\|SELECT \*" --include="*.py"
grep -rn "QueryRow\|Query(" --include="*.go" | grep -v "LIMIT"
# Goroutines or threads launched without lifecycle management
grep -rn "go func\|go .*(" --include="*.go"
# Missing pagination or size limits in new code
git diff <range> | grep -E "^\+.*(\.all\(\)|fetchall|SELECT \*|go func)"
```

#### Python

```python
# VULNERABLE: returns entire table to the client
@router.get("/events")
def get_events(db: Session):
    return db.query(Event).all()  # unbounded -- millions of rows crash the service

# SAFE: enforce pagination limits
@router.get("/events")
def get_events(db: Session, offset: int = 0, limit: int = Query(default=50, le=200)):
    return db.query(Event).offset(offset).limit(limit).all()
```

#### Go

```go
// VULNERABLE: goroutine launched per request with no cancellation
func streamHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    go func() {
        for {
            data := fetchData() // runs forever if client disconnects
            fmt.Fprintln(w, data)
        }
    }()
}

// SAFE: use a ticker so the goroutine yields between iterations instead
// of spinning at full CPU speed when fetchData() returns quickly
func streamHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    ctx := r.Context()
    ticker := time.NewTicker(1 * time.Second)
    defer ticker.Stop()
    go func() {
        for {
            select {
            case <-ctx.Done():
                return // client disconnected -- stop the goroutine
            case <-ticker.C:
                data := fetchData()
                fmt.Fprintln(w, data)
            }
        }
    }()
}
```

**Risk:** Resource exhaustion (CPU, memory, database connections, goroutines/threads) causes service outages.

---

## Sensitive Data in Logs

**Pattern:** Passwords, API keys, tokens, PII, or other secrets written to application logs.

**Detection:**
```bash
# Logging calls that may include sensitive fields
grep -rn "logging\.\|logger\.\|log\.\|slog\.\|zap\." --include="*.py" --include="*.go" | grep -iE "password|token|secret|key|ssn|credit"
```

#### Python

```python
# VULNERABLE: password and token logged in plaintext
import logging
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def login(username: str, password: str):
    logger.info(f"Login attempt: user={username} password={password}")  # password in logs
    token = authenticate(username, password)
    logger.debug(f"Generated token: {token}")  # token in logs
    return token

# SAFE: redact sensitive fields before logging
def login(username: str, password: str):
    logger.info("Login attempt: user=%s", username)  # no password
    token = authenticate(username, password)
    logger.debug("Token generated for user=%s", username)  # no token value
    return token
```

#### Go

```go
// VULNERABLE: secret logged via structured logger
func Login(username, password string) (string, error) {
    slog.Info("login attempt", "user", username, "password", password) // password in logs
    token, err := authenticate(username, password)
    if err != nil {
        return "", err
    }
    slog.Info("token issued", "token", token) // token in logs
    return token, nil
}

// SAFE: omit sensitive fields from log entries
func Login(username, password string) (string, error) {
    slog.Info("login attempt", "user", username) // no password
    token, err := authenticate(username, password)
    if err != nil {
        return "", err
    }
    slog.Info("token issued", "user", username) // no token value
    return token, nil
}
```

**Risk:** Secrets exposed in log aggregation systems, crash dumps, or stdout are accessible to anyone with log access and may violate compliance requirements (GDPR, PCI-DSS).

---
