# Supply Chain Detection Patterns

Common patterns observed in OCI container image security analysis. Load this file
when performing supply chain or CVE analysis steps.

## Pattern 1: Embedded EOL Libraries in Compiled Binaries

**Risk:** A package may vendor or statically link a library that is end-of-life at
the upstream project level, even when the OS-level package for that library is
current. Scanners attribute CVEs to OS packages, not embedded copies.

**How to detect:**
- Run `strings <binary> | grep -E "OpenSSL [0-9]|libcurl/[0-9]"` to surface
  version strings baked into binaries.
- Use `ldd` to identify dynamically linked libraries; compare versions against EOL
  dates.
- Check build metadata and upstream changelogs for vendored dependency pins.

**Example scenario:**
> A TLS-wrapping utility package in a container image embeds OpenSSL 1.0.x (EOL as
> of 2019-12-31) as a static dependency, despite the OS-level `openssl` package
> being a current 3.x version. No CVE is assigned to the utility for this
> condition, but the embedded library is vulnerable to multiple known OpenSSL 1.0.x
> CVEs. The correct attribution is to the utility package as a supply chain risk,
> not to the OS openssl package.

**Escalation criteria:**
- Embedded library is EOL upstream
- Embedded library version is affected by a KEV-listed CVE
- No vendor patch available or planned

## Pattern 2: Vendored libcurl with Unpatched CVEs

**Risk:** Packages that vendor libcurl (rather than linking against the system
library) do not receive OS-level libcurl patches. The package maintainer must
independently vendor updated libcurl releases.

**How to detect:**
- Identify packages with embedded libcurl via:
  `find / -name "libcurl.so*" 2>/dev/null` — multiple hits indicate vendored
  copies.
- Compare embedded version against current libcurl release and known CVE list.
- Check the upstream package source for vendored `curl/` or `libcurl/`
  directories.

**Example scenario:**
> A hardware attestation tool ships a vendored libcurl at a version affected by
> multiple moderate-severity CVEs (including transport-layer and credential handling
> issues). The system `curl` package is patched, but the tool's vendored copy is
> not. This is a supply chain finding against the tool, not a generic libcurl
> finding.

**Escalation criteria:**
- Vendored libcurl version differs from system libcurl version
- Vendored version is affected by CVEs with CVSS >= 7.0
- Package is used in a network-facing or authentication context

## Pattern 3: Unsigned or Unverifiable Base Images

**Risk:** Images built on unverified base layers inherit unknown provenance for all
OS packages and configurations.

**How to detect:**
- Check for cosign/sigstore signature: `cosign verify <image>`
- For Red Hat images: verify presence of `com.redhat.component` label and
  cross-reference against `registry.access.redhat.com`.
- For Docker Hub official images: confirm `Docker Official Image` badge and check
  image definition repository.

**Escalation criteria:**
- No verifiable image signature
- Base image from a non-official publisher on Docker Hub
- Base image label claims Red Hat/UBI origin but is not from
  `registry.access.redhat.com` or `registry.redhat.io`

## Pattern 4: Build Artifacts Left in Production Layers

**Risk:** Compilers, package manager caches, development headers, and test tooling
left in production image layers expand the attack surface and may contain
exploitable tools.

**How to detect:**
- Inspect image layers: `docker history <image>` or `dive <image>`
- Look for: `gcc`, `make`, `pip`, `npm`, `go build` artifacts, `*.a` static
  library files, test suites
- Check `/tmp`, `/root`, and build user home directories for leftover artifacts

**Escalation criteria:**
- Compiler toolchain present in final image layer
- Package manager (pip, npm, yum/dnf) cache present and executable
- Source code present in production image

---

## Pattern 5: Packages with Significantly Lagged Update Cadence

**Risk:** When a package in a container image is many releases behind the upstream
project, it may indicate abandoned maintenance, making future CVE patching
unlikely.

**How to detect:**
- Compare installed package version against current upstream release tag.
- Check upstream project for activity (last commit, last release date).
- Query vendor security advisories for outstanding unpatched CVEs against the
  installed version.

**Escalation criteria:**
- Package is more than 2 major versions behind upstream
- Upstream project shows no activity in 12+ months
- Outstanding HIGH/CRITICAL CVEs with no patch scheduled
