# Configuration Security Patterns

Common patterns observed in OCI container image security analysis. Load this file
during configuration security analysis steps.

## Pattern 1: Default Service Credentials with No Enforcement Mechanism

**Risk:** Services that ship with default credentials (empty passwords, well-known
defaults) and do not enforce credential rotation on first use create a persistent
authentication bypass condition.

**How to detect:**
- Search entrypoint scripts and config files for default credential patterns:

  ```bash
  grep -rE "(password|passwd|secret|token)\s*=\s*(\"\"|\"|''|none|changeme|admin|default)" /etc /opt /app
  ```
- Review service documentation for "default credentials" mentions.
- Check if a credential change is enforced before the service accepts connections,
  or if the service is usable with defaults.

**Example scenario:**
> A system monitoring service container image ships with a default empty password
> for its primary daemon, with no enforced credential change on first run. An
> attacker with network access to the service port can authenticate without
> credentials. This type of finding is distinct from a CVE — it is a configuration
> security issue in the image defaults.

**Escalation criteria:**
- Default credentials are empty or well-known
- No documented procedure to change credentials before service is accessible
- Service is network-exposed by default (listens on 0.0.0.0 or has published port)

## Pattern 2: TLS Advertised but Disabled or Optional by Default

**Risk:** A service that documents TLS support but ships with TLS disabled or
optional by default may be deployed without encryption, even by operators who
believe they are protected.

**How to detect:**
- Compare image documentation/labels claiming TLS support against actual config
  file defaults.
- Look for config keys like `tls_enabled = false`, `ssl = off`,
  `require_ssl = no`, or equivalent.
- Check whether TLS is opt-in (must be explicitly enabled) versus opt-out (enabled
  by default, can be disabled).

**Example scenario:**
> A security-sensitive service container image documents TLS as a supported feature
> in its README and image labels. However, the default configuration shipped in the
> image has TLS disabled for a key component. Deployments following the "quick
> start" path run without TLS encryption, contradicting the service's security
> claims. This type of finding is a configuration security issue, not a CVE — the
> misconfiguration is in the shipped defaults.

**Escalation criteria:**
- TLS is explicitly advertised as a security feature but off by default
- The service handles sensitive data (keys, attestation results, credentials)
- The quick-start or default deployment path bypasses TLS entirely

## Pattern 3: Credential Files with Insecure Permissions in Image Layers

**Risk:** Configuration files containing credentials (API keys, database passwords,
TLS private keys) baked into an image with world-readable permissions expose those
credentials to any process running in the container.

**How to detect:**
- Inspect image layers for credential file permission issues:

  ```bash
  find / \( -name "*.key" -o -name "*.pem" -o -name "*secret*" -o -name "*password*" \) \
    -not -path "/proc/*" -exec ls -la {} \; 2>/dev/null
  ```
- Check for files with 0644 or 0755 permissions that contain private key material.

**Escalation criteria:**
- Private key or credential file is world-readable (mode 644 or broader)
- Credential is a default that is not rotated per-deployment
- File is in a layer that would be accessible to other containers sharing the image

## Pattern 4: Environment Variable Credential Injection without Documentation

**Risk:** Images that accept credentials via environment variables without
documenting this pattern may lead operators to hardcode secrets in `docker run`
commands, CI/CD scripts, or Kubernetes manifests in plaintext.

**How to detect:**
- Review entrypoint scripts for `$PASSWORD`, `$SECRET`, `$API_KEY`, `$TOKEN`
  references.
- Check whether the image documentation recommends using secrets management
  (Kubernetes Secrets, Vault, etc.) or simply shows `docker run -e PASSWORD=...`.

**Escalation criteria:**
- Credentials consumed from environment variables with no secrets management
  guidance
- Image documentation shows plaintext credential examples without disclaimer
- No support for file-based credential injection (e.g., `/run/secrets/`)

---

## Pattern 5: Privileged Runtime Requirements Baked into Default Configuration

**Risk:** Images that require `--privileged`, `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`, or other elevated
capabilities by default unnecessarily expand the blast radius of container escape
vulnerabilities.

**How to detect:**
- Review entrypoint scripts for capability-dependent operations (mount, raw socket,
  device access).
- Check image documentation for capability requirements.
- Test image startup without elevated capabilities to identify the minimal required
  set.

**Escalation criteria:**
- `--privileged` is required for basic (non-advanced) functionality
- `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` or `CAP_NET_ADMIN` required without documented justification
- No documented least-privilege capability set provided
